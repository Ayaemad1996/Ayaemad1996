 I, aya,
 I love teaching a lot, as 
 I graduated in 2018 from the Faculty of Education, Mansoura University, 
 Department of Biology, and two years before my graduation,
 I started practicing the teaching profession. In my private work through some private lessons and giving lessons in many centers such as the Knowledge Center, the First Center and the Beauty Center, thank God, my reputation has become very good, but due to Coronaâ€™s circumstances, I decided to return to work via the Internet, so to maintain my safety and the safety of my students at the current stage, I started training on How to create content and deal with applications such as Application Zoom, Viber and others.
Certificates obtained
- Certificate of Education, Mansoura University, 2018.
- Diploma in Medical Analysis from the Faculty of Science, Mansoura University, 2020.
I am currently completing my master's degree.
